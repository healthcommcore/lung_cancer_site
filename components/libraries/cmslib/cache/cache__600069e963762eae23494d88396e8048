		Hi Thomas,  <br /> <br />Glad you found it helpful!  <br /> <br />I have definitely found a way that works for me, but since everyone is different, does anyone else have any stories to share about how they remember to take their vitamin?  <br /> <br />Let us know - I'm sure someone will find it useful!  <br /> <br />Pointing you in a healthy direction,  <br />Sarah

		In addition to multis, I have to remember to take low dose aspirin and calcium plus 3 other necessary med.  So I use an ice cube tray and put it in my make-up drawer.  Since I wouldn't ever go out without makeup or earrings, I never forget to take them.  I also keep a small dixie cup dispenser on my dresser so I have water.  That's what works for me!

		Hi Maria, <br /> <br />Wow. I bet you would never forget! I've never heard of using an ice cube tray. I think that is very creative. I'm always impressed by what people come up with. I had guests over last week who asked about my sticky notes on the back of my front door and one mentioned that she always kept two bottles of multivitamins--one at home and one at the office--so, in case she forgets to take a multivitamin at home, she can take one at work! <br /> <br />Thanks for sharing! More stories perhaps, everyone else? <br /> <br />Pointing you in a healthy direction, <br />Sarah
