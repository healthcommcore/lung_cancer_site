		Scheduling a time of day to walk with a friend works well for me. We both look forward to the time. We walk four times a week, varying walk locations that challenge us with inclines, steep climbs, and/or stair steps. Since we don't walk together every day I put in time by walking to and from work, to meetings that are local, and during lunch when I can.  We also partner for yoga classes and plan to take dance classes and bike ride together.
