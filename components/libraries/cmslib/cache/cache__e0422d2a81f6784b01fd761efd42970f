		Since I prepare my own breakfast 6 days a week, the vitamins I take recomends I take them on a full stomach.  I went on that website trackmychanges and ran off a lot of those receipts that looked good and bought the ingredients and prepared one of them and found it to be very good. Then I ran of receipts for deserts,side dishes,appetizers and main Courses all that looked very appetizing. I've been practising my Culinary art for a long time,should I say since I retired a long time ago.

		Hi Alfred,  <br /> <br />It sounds like you are a great chef!  I love cooking too and am always on the lookout for quick and easy recipes â€“ the Healthy Directions recipes seem perfect for this!  <br /> <br />Which Healthy Directions recipe did you try? I have made the <a href="http://help.trackmychanges.org/index.php?option=com_recipe&view=recipe&id=158"target="_blank">Fruit Slush</a> several times for an afternoon snack - it's delicious! This weekend when it was cold outside, I also tried the <a href="http://help.trackmychanges.org/index.php?option=com_recipe&view=recipe&id=160"target="_blank">Corn and Black Bean Chili</a>. It was very filling and the perfect amount of spice for me. <br /> <br />There are lots of recipes to choose from under the recipe tab on the Healthy Directions website. I would love to hear which ones people have tried and how they turned out. Or, if anyone has their own great healthy recipes, feel free to share them here!  <br /> <br />Pointing you in healthy direction, <br />Sarah <br />

		I never forget my vitamins.  I keep them in a special days of the week container and take most of them at breakfast.  My husband takes them too.
