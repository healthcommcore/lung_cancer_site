		I pack my multivitamin in with my lunch, since I do this everyday for work.  I am still trying to figure out what to do on weekends...so I will give your suggestions a try.

		Thanks, Mark.  I hope these ideas will help you to remember to take your multivitamin on the weekend.  Connecting the multivitamin with something else you typically do on the weekend might help, or asking a buddy to remind you. <br /> <br />Let me know how it goes! <br /> <br />Pointing you in a healthy direction, <br />Sarah
