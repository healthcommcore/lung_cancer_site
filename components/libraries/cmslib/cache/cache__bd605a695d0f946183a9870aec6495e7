		Hi Jamie, what wonderful news! Thanks for sharing. You and your buddy have done all the work. And it sounds like you are well prepared to continue with your committment. The power of a good buddy can make all the difference. Through this program, I have talked with people who have had buddies and tracked their progress for many years! One participant has tracked his exercise for over 10 years and every year he tries to do a little bit more.  His sister is his exercise buddy.  Continue to focus on what has worked for you in the program for long-term success. <br /> <br />Pointing you in a healthy direction, <br />Sarah
