		My husband and I signed up for dance classes this fall and they have been great fun!  We wanted to find something we could do together indoors when the weather gets cold and this is the perfect thing for us.

		Hi Michelle, I am a big fan of the show, too! Dancing is an incredible workout and so much fun. It sounds like this is a great way for you to mix up your physical activity and keep things interesting. <br /> <br />Any other dancers out there? I would love to hear from you. <br /> <br />Pointing you in a healthy direction, <br />Sarah
