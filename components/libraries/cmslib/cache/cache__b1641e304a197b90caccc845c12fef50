		Hi Michelle, I am a big fan of the show, too! Dancing is an incredible workout and so much fun. It sounds like this is a great way for you to mix up your physical activity and keep things interesting. <br /> <br />Any other dancers out there? I would love to hear from you. <br /> <br />Pointing you in a healthy direction, <br />Sarah
