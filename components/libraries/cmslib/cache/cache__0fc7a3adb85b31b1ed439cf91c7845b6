		Sarah, So Sorry to hear about your knitting attempts.  I have found knitting to be so helpful for changing my habits. A study done by Harvard found that yoga, meditation and knitting had the same effects on the body;lower pulse,relaxation, focus. I can't nibble on chocolate while knitting and I have accomplished something when I can wear that scarf that everyone admires. Good for my well-being also.And now that I have lost my job,that sense of accomplishment is even more important in keeping up my moral. If you want to try again, look for a knitting group to join. I have been with one for 10 years and what support and laughter(another good medicine)it has provided. In the Boston area? Knitsmiths at Brookline Booksmith is great. I love being part of Healthy Directions. It has made me so much more aware of lots of things. I have already lost weight(important to get my cholesterol down) and have put more motion in my moments. <br />Thanks for the support, <br />Jo <br />

		Hi Josephine, <br /> <br />Thank you for sharing! I think it is important for anyone to have a hobby to relax or energize. I am glad that you enjoy knitting and are making beautiful scarves. Knitsmiths sound like a wonderful place to keep in mind and help me try again this year for the holidays. I am so sorry for your job loss. I hope that you will find one that you will like very soon. I think, in every challenge, it is important to keep having joy and laughter in our lives, and surround ourselves with supportive friends and family. Friends and family can often help us pull through challenges. In Healthy Directions, we think that many people can have a buddy or be a buddy, to help us all be more healthy with a big smile. <br /> <br />Does anyone else have a story to share about how friends and family have helped them through challenges to reach their goals? <br /> <br />Pointing you in a healthy direction,  <br />Sarah
